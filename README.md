# Graphiql (with some spice)

This is a simple GraphQL fetcher with support for adding an auth token (and possibly some other stuff, if you're feeling adventurous).

To get started, simply create a `config.js` file in the __src__ directory (using `config.example.js` as a template) and edit it to suit your needs.

Then `yarn && yarn start`, and you're good to go
